# Exploratory Data Analysis of Instagram Social Media Reach

# Project Overview

Instagram produces a wealth of data daily. Content creators keenly analyze engagement and reach to identify the types of posts that perform well. In this project, I delved into an Instagram dataset for an exploratory analysis. The aim was to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, empowering better decision-making and the development of strategies for maximizing reach and engagement through content posting.

# Dataset and Data Source

The Instagram Data was collected from the Keggle and the dataset contain features such as: 

Impressions: Number of impressions in a post (Reach)
From Home: Reach from home
From Hashtags: Reach from Hashtags
From Explore: Reach from Explore
From Other: Reach from other sources
Saves: Number of saves
Comments: Number of comments
Shares: Number of shares
Likes: Number of Likes
Profile Visits: Numer of profile visits from the post
Follows: Number of Follows from the post
Caption: Caption of the post
Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post


Conduct exploratory analysis to identify post categories with high engagement, understand posting frequency impact, and provide insights for informed decision-making in content creation.
